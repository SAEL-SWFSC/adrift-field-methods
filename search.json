While the remote control is very convenient, it can be very difficult to see the green light indictator (to show that you turned it on) on the ST4300, and it is impossible to see it on the ST640 (it is internal).\n\n\nRecording Schedule\nSelect Periodic Recording. Record for a period of 6 minutes every 6 minutes. This will allow the recording schedule to be set to continuous sampling with 6 minute files.\n\n\nSample Rate\nSelect the maximum sample rate for the recorder (this varies by recorder)\n\n\nDetector\nDO NOT SELECT any detectors.\n\n\nAncillary Sensors\n✓ Acceleration (Not temperature), Log every 10 seconds.\n\n\nOther\n✓ Disable calibration tones\n\n\nConfirm the status of the Sound Trap after it is programmed\nAfter a ST640 is programmed and disconnected from a laptop, the LED should flash red to indicate it is programmed to start at a later time. The LED will flash green if it is actively recording.\nIf the LED does not flash at all after the Sound Trap is disconnected, it must be re-connected to the laptop and re-programmed.\n\n\n\nClean Sound Trap O-rings and seal the unit\n\nRemove O-rings and clean the gaps. Replace the O-rings if any irregularity is found. Apply a thin layer of lubricant to the rings.\nClose the unit, and tighten the screw until it resists. Then unscrew it just a hair to be sure.\nApply a layer of plumbers tape (roughly 3 layers thick) around the crease, and ensure the tape settles into the crease.\nApply a layer of self-sealing tape. Cut roughly 6 inches off the roll and tightly stretch it around the outside, covering all of the pipe tape.\nSecure in place with electrical tape, covering all of the self-sealing tape.\n\n\n\nGreasing SoundTrap/Hydrophone Connectors\nGrease the SoundTrap sockets prior to connecting it to the hydrophone array\n\nApply a layer of grease to the socket. Ensure all sockets are completely sealed with approximately 30% of the hole filled, and leave a transparent layer of grease on the socket face\nConnect the hydrophone array plugs to the SoundTrap sockets and remove any excess grease from the joint\nFirmly attach the locking sleeve\nSee links below for detailed greasing protocol (steps with pictures and video) \n\nGreasing steps with pictures\nSubConn greasing and mating under water (wet mate)\n\n\nSecuring Hydrophones before next deployment\n\nOver time, the hydrophones may become loose in the array mounts leading to noise in the data\nIf the hydrophone is loose, tighten the bolts and nuts or remove the mount and reposition the hydrophone \nSome hydrophone models may fit into the mount better, but all should be tightly secured and not hitting the surrounding array parts\n\nGrey mount\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack mount\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Solar GPS\n\nPlace solar GPS in view of sky (satellites) and remove magnet\nCheck online to ensure that the solar GPS is being updated (check with ADRIFT team to obtain login information)\nSet up Driftwatch auto-text update (if desired)."

The two essential roles for recovery include someone to grab the buoy and pull it in, and someone to store gear and watch for the drogue/hydrophones coming out of the water. These tasks can be completed by more than two people as needed.\nDepending on the size of the vessel and sea state, there are two main methods to retrieve the buoy;\n\nApproach the High Flyer and have a crew grab the pole buoy to lift it on board\nUse a boat hook or grapple to grab the line between the pole buoy and the 11” surface float and use the grapple/line to pull the High Flyer on board\n\n\nThe best retrieval location may be from a mid-ship station, but extreme care is needed to ensure that the vessel does not drift over the top of the line (we recommend moving to stern once initial connection is made). The vessel will drift faster than the buoy, and thus the vessel should remain downwind from the buoy (so that it does not drift over the buoy). Try approaching slowly in an upwind direction (going upwind) and ask the vessel to hold position into the wind while the Drifting Acoustic Buoy is retrieved. In windy conditions, extreme care is needed to keep the ship from drifting over the top of the line.\nWatch this video for an overview of the entire deployment and retrieval process (old video).\n\nRetrieval\n\nShip approaches last known location (using solar GPS)\nSlowly approach area to find the buoy\n\nDuring daylight hours, it may be visible via radar, binoculars, or using big-eyes during\nAt night, the reflective tape can be seen at ranges up to ½ mile.

    "text": "Whenever a SoundTrap is recovered, it is necessary to check for potential flooding of the instrument. Hold the SoundTrap with the end caps facing away from your body and tilt the instrument back and forth to listen for the movement of water within the housing. If the SoundTrap contains water, the batteries have likely been damaged, and the recorder may be pressurized with electrolytic gasses from the batteries. If flooded, you may also notice gas bubbles emerging from the end cap.\nThese gasses and contaminated seawater are hazardous if exposed to eyes, skin, or airways. Special precautions are needed to ensure your safety before the SoundTrap can be opened. See first aid information below.\nPersonnel\nTwo people who have training in handling hazardous materials, including\n\nOne person to open the SoundTrap\nOne person to assist and take photos\n\nMaterials\n\nFull Personal Protective Equipment for each person present, including: \n\nLab coat\nSafety goggles\nFace mask\nThick latex gloves (dishwashing gloves are fine)\n\nFire extinguisher\nAllen wrench\nBucket to collect hazardous waste, rinse water, and contaminated paper towels\nCardboard sheet (an old box is fine)\nChemical Absorbent pads\nPaper towels\nLarge plastic bags to store contaminated batteries and instrument\nCamera to document damage\n\nInstructions\n\nIdentify a safe, well-ventilated area to open the SoundTrap which is away from any flammable materials\nWear full PPE, including lab coat, safety goggles, face mask, thick latex gloves\nHave fire extinguisher standing by, with an assistant standing by to call for help if needed\nLay cardboard on ground, and absorbent pads on top of cardboard to collect contaminated seawater and battery contents\nTake photos to document the external condition of the SoundTrap\nDO NOT OPEN THE TOP OF THE SOUNDTRAP. Locate the set screw in the base of the SoundTrap. This is designed as a safe pressure release valve. Slowly open this safety valve, with the end cap facing away from all people. Allow any gas to escape and drain contaminated water into a bucket. \nTake photos to document the internal condition of the SoundTrap before it is cleaned up\nUse paper towels to dry off all batteries and the instrument. Store contaminated paper towels within the bucket.\nRemove batteries, dry them off, and store them in a separate plastic bag\nRemove SD cards, rinse them with fresh water, dry them off, and set aside to check for usable data. \nHold the SoundTrap canister and recorder over the hazardous waste bucket and rinse with fresh water. Capture all rinse water in the bucket. Use paper towels to dry the SoundTrap completely. Leave SoundTrap on a counter to dry out completely, if possible.\nTake photos of cleaned SoundTrap components. \nLabel and arrange for appropriate disposal of hazardous waste bucket and batteries. Contact lab safety or environmental health & safety team for assistance. Refer to the [battery product information sheet](../content/Panasonic_LithiumIon_Battery_Product_Information_Sheet.pdf) for more information on first aid and appropriate disposal. Note that local authorities may have more stringent rules than federal guidelines.\n\nFirst Aid If you get electrolyte in your eyes, flush with water for 15 minutes without rubbing and immediately contact a physician. If you get electrolyte on your skin, wash the area immediately with soap and water. If irritation continues, contact a physician. If the battery is ingested, call the National Capital Poison Control (NCPC) at 202-625-3333 or your local poison control center immediately."

If the center hole of the crab float is not wide enough to fit over the pole, an auger can be used to drill out the middle (ask for more help).\nAdd weights to one end of the pole at the very bottom. The pole mounted cylindrical weights should be drilled to fit the pole. Once this weight is secured in place, add the 5 lb flexible wire weight over the top of the pole weight.\nAdd radar reflector (first) and then insert the Solar GPS mount on top. Drill a hole through all three (pole, radar reflector, and gps mount) and use a thru-bolt to secure in place. Add a locking nut or electrical tape over the top of the nut to reduce chance of nut working itself loose.\nAdd reflector tape near the top of the buoy.\nAdd bridle to the pole buoy: 12 strand crab fishing line with 2@ hose for reducing wear on the line. Tie one end of the line around the pole buoy above the crab floats, and one below the crab floats (with the hose protecting where the line encircles the pole). Tie well and use zip ties to secure the line if needed. Put a loop in the middle of this line so that the surface floats can be clipped onto this loop using a caribiner.\n\nFloat test\n\nPut in calm water (at a marina or pool) to determine positioning of the crab floats vertically on the pole. If the floats are too low, the buoy will be unstable (pull the top of the pole over and see how well the buoy rights itself). We want the pole buoy to be stable, but also to have sufficient height for viewing (for retrieval!) and for good GPS transmission.\nMark the top/bottom position of the crab floats on the pole.\nPut thru-bolts above and below the crab floats to secure them in place."

    "section": "Driftwatch",
    "text": "Driftwatch\nDriftWatch was developed by our team (Taiki Sakai) to help us track our buoys. Ocean currents can be unpredictable, so having a near-real-time tool to keep track of buoy positions is very useful. DriftWatch automatically downloads GPS data for each buoy, and creates plots of their drift tracks with the ocean currents every hour. These get uploaded to a Google Drive folder so that it is easy for anyone to access them.\nDriftwatch currently consists of 3 functions:\n\nDrift Maps. Maps of current deployments, updated hourly\nTest Deployments. Allows user to create a map of potential deployment locations overlaid on ocean currents\nText Location Updates. Sends text message updates on buoy location to aid retrieval.\n\n\nDrift Maps\nMaps will automatically be made for any deployments that DriftWatch knows about. To add a new deployment, you need to fill in information in the NEW DEPLOYMENT TO SAVE tab of the Deployment Details worksheet. The important fields for DriftWatch are:\n\nDeployment_Date_UTC - The date of deployment. This is when DriftWatch will start creating maps. This can just be a date initially, but should eventually be updated to an accurate deployment time.\nData_Start_UTC - To be filled in later, the start of usable data on the recording. \nRecovery_Date_UTC - The date of recovery. This is when DriftWatch will stop creating maps. This can just be a date initially, but should eventually be updated to an accurate deployment time.\nData_End_UTC - To be filled in later, the end of usable data on the recording. \nGPS ID - The ID(s) for the trackers attached to this deployment. Should be letters for SPOT devices, or SO-### for solar devices. If multiple trackers are used, they should be separated by a /\nProject - Project name, e.g ADRIFT\nDeploymentID - Deployment number for this project\nSite - Optional, a 3 letter code for the deployment site. Should be one of the options on the “Site List” tab of the worksheet\n\nOnce these are filled in, DriftWatch will add this drift to its known deployments the next time it runs, and maps will be made. The remainder of the fields are not used by DriftWatch, but should be filled in if you have the information.\nPlots are uploaded to the “DriftPlots” folder every hour, and are named according to the following naming scheme:\n\nProject_DeploymentID_Current_DeployDate_Site.png\n\n“Current” is either HYCOM or HFRADAR depending on which source of ocean current data is being used. DriftWatch will always try to make a plot using both, but occasionally it can run into errors trying to download the data so you may only see one. HYCOM data have excellent coverage everywhere, but the major downside is that they are only updated once a day, typically in the morning. This means that the current picture may not look accurate later in the day. HFRADAR is updated much more frequently, but there are many areas that do not have any coverage for HFRADAR, so your plot may not show any data. Additionally, the HFRADAR data source has been much more finicky, and can often be unavailable for download. All plots show the last time the current data was updated at the bottom.\n\n\n\nGPS CSV Files\nDriftWatch will also create CSV files of the coordinates for any completed drifts. These are stored in the GPS_CSV folder within the main DriftWatch folder, each file is named with DriftName_GPS.csv. Each CSV file is also paired with a map showing the extent of the drift stored in the CSV, the purpose of these is to give a quick visual check of the track to make sure no extra data points are being stored. If the deployment start or recovery dates have not been updated, it is likely that there are a number of coordinates included that are not actually part of the drift but part of the boat track. These should be easy to see within the map, so before using any CSV files you should check the map for any obvious issues. These GPS CSVs also have some quality checks applied to try and remove any incorrect GPS points, or any obvious boat track portions. This works by removing any coordinates where the average speed between points is greater than 4 knots. The CSV files also contain two additional columns other than the coordinates and UTC times:\n\nknots- the average speed between consecutive points. Note that if multiple GPS devices are used on a single drift, then this speed value is only calculated between points from the same device. \nrecordingEffort - a TRUE/FALSE column marking where recording effort is on, defined by the DataStart and DataEnd columns in the deploymentDetails worksheet. If these have not been filled in, then the entire column will be FALSE. \n\nIf you notice that one of the GPS tracks has incorrect start or end times (obvious boat track included in the image), then the most likely cause is that the Deployment or Recovery times are still listed as just dates in the deploymentDetails, and need to be updated to an accurate Date Time. Once this has been done, then you can trigger a new version of the CSV to be created by deleting it within the GPS_CSV folder. If there are still issues with the GPS then contact Taiki Sakai (taiki.sakai@noaa.gov) and he will adjust it manually.\n\n\nTest Deployments\nThere is a Google Sheet within the main DriftWatch folder called “TestDeployments” that lets you create plots of the currents at specific locations. The main idea for this is to keep an eye on the currents of potential deployment sites, since deploying into a strong offshore current can lead to big problems. This worksheet contains the following columns:\n\nLatitude/Longitude - The coordinates to create the plot. A marker will be left at these coordinates, and the map will be centered here\nName - A name for this test deployment, should be unique from other deployments. If you want to draw multiple points on the same plot, then you can give multiple points the same name\nDeploymentSite - Optional, only used for labeling. Same as DeploymentSite in regular plots\nLatRange/LonRange - Optional, lets you control the displayed range of the plot. Can either be given as min, max separated by a comma, or if it is a single value then this defines how far to extend the bounds in each direction from the drawn point. For example, if a point is at a Latitude of 32, then LatRange of 31, 33 OR LatRange of 1 will both give the same result. \nPlotEndDate - Optional (but highly recommended) - This tells DriftWatch when it can stop creating the plots. The plot upload process is quite slow, so if there are too many plots the whole process takes quite a while. So if you want to keep an eye on a location for a potential deployment on October 20th, then setting an end date of 10/21/2022 would be ideal.\nNote - Optional, used only for your personal use. Some rows also contain notes with reminders for how to use this spreadsheet.\n\nThese plots get created every hour, at the same time as the regular plots. They get uploaded to the “TestDeploymentPlots” folder.\n\n\nText Updates\nThis is a very beta feature that has been somewhat unreliable, but when it is working it can send updates of the most recent location of buoys to an email address or as a test message to a cell phone or satellite phone. This is to make sure that people on the boat retrieving buoys can have easy access to the most up-to-date locations to make the process go smoothly. \nSetup requires filling out information in the TextUpdates worksheet. The “Schedule” tab contains the following columns:\n\nStart_Local - Time to start sending text messages (local / PDT). Date format must be YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\nEnd_Local - Time to stop sending text messages (local / PDT). Date format must be YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\nDeployment_Name - The name of the drift you want updates for, must exactly match the name of the drift (e.g. ADRIFT_004 not ADRIFT_4). If you want updates on multiple buoys they must be on separate lines\nRecipient_Id - The ID number for who should receive the messages, from the “Contacts” tab. If multiple people want messages, they must be on different rows.\nCoord_Style - Tag specifying formatting style for coordinates. One of dms, deciminute, or decidegree corresponding to 32°24’54”, 32°24.9’, or 32.415\nNote - Contains reminders, otherwise for personal use\n\nAlso fill out the “Contacts” tab with the following columns\n\nId - The ID number you refer to from the “Schedule” tab\nName - Name of person receiving message\nNumber - Phone number\nProvider - Cell service provider. Used to lookup the proper extension for sending text as email\nExtension - Sending a text via e-mail is done by sending an email to PHONENUMBER@EXTENSION where the extension depends on the cell service provider. If you aren’t sure how to find this, let me know and I can look it up for you\nEmail - The combination of the number and extension. Alternatively if you only want an e-mail and not text messages, you can put that here. This is the important field that actually gets read by DriftWatch\nNotes - Contains instructs and personal notes\n\nMessages are sent out every 30 minutes, at approximately XX:10 and XX:40. The message will contain the most recent coordinates for the drift selected, as well as an approximate heading and speed (knots) calculated using the last two GPS points. The message will also list the time of the last update (local / PDT), so users can tell if it has been a long time since the last update and use the speed/heading to estimate a potential current location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe currently are only allowed 200 messages per day, so please limit the number of people receiving messages! Estimate how many you will be sending per day (2 per hour per drift per person) to make sure you fall within this limit, and set your start / end times sensibly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is currently in very beta mode, and is still being tested. Some users have been able to receive test messages prior to fieldwork, but then no messages were received while out. Other users have not been able to receive messages at all. Please test before you plan on using it, reach out if you need help."
