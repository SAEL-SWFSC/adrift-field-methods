At the surface, the line attaches to the surface float (orange 11” float with 18.5 lbs buoyancy), which is connected to the High Flyer by a thick orange dyneema line and a bridle (⅜” crab rope attached above/below the High Flyer float). At the deep end, the line attaches to a drogue to minimize horizontal movement and rubber ‘snubber’ (or bungee) to reduce vertical motion. Below the drogue and snubber is a  sub-surface float (orange 11” float with 18.5 buoyancy) and Dampener Plate to maintain vertical orientation and minimize vertical movement. The hydrophone array is attached to the bottom of the Dampener Plate."

    "text": "Depending on the size of the vessel and sea state, there are two main methods to retrieve the buoy;\n\nApproach the High Flyer and have a crew grab the pole buoy to lift it on board\nUse a boat hook or grapple to grab the line between the pole buoy and the 11” surface float and use the grapple/line to pull the High Flyer on board\n\n\nThe best retrieval location may be from a mid-ship station, but extreme care is needed to ensure that the vessel does not drift over the top of the line (we recommend moving to stern once initial connection is made). The vessel will drift faster than the buoy, and thus the vessel should remain downwind from the buoy (so that it does not drift over the buoy). Try approaching slowly in an upwind direction (going upwind) and ask the vessel to hold position into the wind while the Drifting Acoustic Buoy is retrieved. In windy conditions, extreme care is needed to keep the ship from drifting over the top of the line.\nWatch this video for an overview of the entire deployment and retrieval process (old video).\n\n\n\nShip approaches last known location (using solar GPS)\nSlowly approach area to find the buoy\n\nDuring daylight hours, it may be visible via radar, binoculars, or using big-eyes during\nAt night, the reflective tape can be seen at ranges up to ½ mile. Use a spotlight (the ship’s or spare scientist spotlight) to illuminate the reflective tape\n\nUsing a boat hook or grapple, grab the orange floating line \nRetrieve the hook, orange float, and orange line, and pull all components in by hand using gloves\nBring the pole buoy aboard, lift over rail and set it on the deck\nRetrieve the line; if a winch is used, ensure that there is a lookout to remove line from winch before reaching the drogue and subsurface components.\nCarefully retrieve the hydrophone array\n\nHold the hydrophone array away from the vessel lip as you are retrieving it to avoid bumping the hydrophone elements against the ship\nLift the recorders gently over the rail\n\nRetrieve the anchor\nLog the date, time, and updated location of the retrieval with the in the Deployment Details spreadsheet, and send this information to send this information to Kourtney (kourtney.burger@noaa.gov)\nWash, clean, and dry all equipment\n\nRemove any marine fouling with a power washer and rinse everything with fresh water\nStack the line on a dry deck in the sun to fully dry \n\nRemove the High Flyer and the anchor from the array/line/orange buoys\nMove the array, line, and orange hard floats into the tote\n\nPlease do not stack floats, the anchor, or other items on top of the hydrophone array (hydrophone and recorder)\n\nRemember the recorder may be recording, you can turn it off or let it run out of battery\nTurn off the solar GPS by replacing the magnet onto the GPS and secure it with tape. \nContact Shannon Rankin (shannon.rankin@noaa.gov) for next steps"
