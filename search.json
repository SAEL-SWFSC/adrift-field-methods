At the surface, the line attaches to the surface float (orange 11\" float with 18.5 lbs buoyancy), which is connected to the High Flyer by a thick orange dyneema line and a bridle (⅜\" crab rope attached above/below the High Flyer float). At the deep end, the line attaches to a drogue to minimize horizontal movement and rubber 'snubber' (or bungee) to reduce vertical motion. Below the drogue and snubber is a  sub-surface float (orange 11\" float with 18.5 buoyancy) and Dampener Plate to maintain vertical orientation and minimize vertical movement. The hydrophone array is attached to the bottom of the Dampener Plate."
