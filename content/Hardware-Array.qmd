## Hardware- Array

Two hydrophones create a vertical array with 5m separation at 100m depth. There is also a depth sensor attached near the top of the array. A Soundtrap 4300 or ST-640 4-channel recorder is attached directly to the hydrophone arrays at 100m depth with heavy duty cable ties or bungee cords.
