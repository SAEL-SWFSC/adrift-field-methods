1.  At the end of each deployment, always rinse all equipment with fresh water

2.  Inspect equipment for any corrosion, debris, or damage to the lines, cables, hydrophones, and SoundTraps

3.  Remove the SoundTrap, carefully place the array into its tote and ensure there are no kinks in the cable or anything pushing against the hydrophones

The hydrophone plugs and SoundTrap sockets should be cleaned after each deployment

1.  Use a spray based contact cleaner and a soft applicator (Q-tip) to clean any debris off and wipe dry with a KimWipe
