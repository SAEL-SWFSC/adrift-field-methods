To Do: Need to modify based on comments from Anne Simonis in comments
\[here\](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aZlt35hdcS8rShcebh86d_tzudtN4Cht/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102241654798114401528&rtpof=true&sd=true>)

## Configure

1.  Set computer clock to UTC

2.  Plug in Reefnet sensor reader & place depth sensor on reader

3.  Open Reefnet Sensus Ultra Software (https://reefnet.ca/downloads/)

    1.  Settings-\> set up appropriate Com Port

    2.  Put sensor on reader (small vertical pins align with screws on
        sensor)

    4.  Data Library-\> Configure Device (select Read Device
        Information)

    5.  Configurable Options-\> select 60 seconds (apply)

    6.  Once you get popup stating “Settings changed successfully!”, it
        is ready for use!

## Prepare for Deployment

1.  Ensure data downloaded & sensor set to 60 second update (see other
    sections in this document)

2.  Attach sensor with zip tie to the top of the array (\>1m from
    nearest hydrophone)

3.  Log Depth Sensor ID on instrument log (which Array is it with?)

## Download Depth Data

1.  Plug in Reefnet sensor reader & place depth sensor on reader

2.  Note Depth Sensor ID & array/buoy it was deployed with

3.  Open Reefnet Sensus Ultra Software (https://reefnet.ca/downloads/)

    1.  Settings-\> set up appropriate Com Port

    2.  Put sensor on reader (small vertical pins align with screws on
        sensor)

        ![](images/sensusReader.png){width="227"}

    3.  Press ‘Download Device’

    4.  Select Read user data/Write User Data

    5.  Click on Device ID in list on Data Library Tab

    6.  Click on date of desired deployment

    7.  Click 'Export CSV'

    8.  Include depth sensor ID in filename

### Battery and Memory Status

The Sensus Ultra contains a permanent lithium cell battery. It is not
rechargeable and normal voltage levels range between 3.2 - 3.6 V. Before
deployments, the battery should be checked for any significant drop in
voltage (anything more than 0.2 V) and should not be used if the voltage
is under 3 V.

To check battery voltage, connect the sensor to a computer and open the
Sensus Manager software. Click "Configure Device" and then "Read Device
Information" to see the battery voltage.

The Sensus will automatically overwrite the oldest data as necessary to
store new data. Depth data should be offloaded immediately after each
deployment.
