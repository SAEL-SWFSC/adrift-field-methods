# Surface Buoy
The purpose of the surface buoy is to help track, find, and support the
drifting recorder. For the Adrift survey, we used a high-flyer style of pole buoy with satellite trackers mounted on the pole and the array is suspended below. A robust spar buoy developed at PIFSC was implemented as part of the CALCURCEAS survey in 2024.


## Pole Buoy

The purpose of the pole buoy is to help track, find, and support the
drifting recorder. The pole buoy consists of;

1.  **Aluminum Pole:** 9' length, 1.25" 6063 aluminum round tube
2.  **Lead Weight:** approximately 17 lbs, attached to the bottom of the
    pole to keep buoy vertical
3.  **Crab Floats:** to keep pole buoy floating, with bolts above and
    below it to keep it from sliding along the pole
4.  **Bridle:** 12 strand line that links the pole buoy to the rest of
    the drifting recorder setup and arrray
5.  **Radar reflector:** so ships can see the pole buoy
6.  **GPS mount:** to hold the solar GPS and strobe light
