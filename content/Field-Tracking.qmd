## Driftwatch

Driftwatch is a tool used to keep track of our buoys in near-real-time. It will automatically download GPS data from the buoy and then create a plot of the drift every hour.

You can track your buoy by checking the [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10LOJhEUO6mfjY0LmXwmm2iu0JH70uj6x?usp=sharing)that these plots are stored in, or by signing up to receive text message or e-mail updates of the current locations of the deployed buoys. This feature is in beta testing and is somewhat unreliable.
