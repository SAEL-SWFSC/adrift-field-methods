## PIFSC Spar Buoy (page in progress)

The purpose of the PIFSC buoy is to help track, find, and support the
drifting recorder. We will be using these on the CalCurCEAS 2024 cruise
along with our pole buoys. The PIFSC buoy consists of;

1.  **PCV Head Piece:** PVC head piece that unscrews an encloses spot
    GPS devices
2.  **Float collar:** High density foam collar that bolts around main
    body of buoy
3.  **Main PVC body:** Enclosed main PVC body to help keep the buoy
    afloat
4.  **Spar whip:** Blue steel line that attaches to the the main body
    via a bolt sheathed in a PVC pipe. The other end attaches to the top
    end of the array.
5.  **Hand Strap:** Blue steel line that attaches to the float collar
    and the bottom of the main PVC body. Used to pull the buoy onto the
    vessel
6.  **Grappling point:** Line attached to the float collar and surface
    buoy. Used to throw a grappling hook or gaff to retrieve buoy
7.  **Surface buoy:** Surface float that attaches to locking collar
