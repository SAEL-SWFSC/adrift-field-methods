## PIFSC Spar Buoy (page in progress)

The purpose of the PIFSC buoy is to help track, find, and support the
drifting recorder. We will be using these on the CalCurCEAS 2024 cruise
along with our pole buoys. The PIFSC buoy consists of;

1.  **PCV Head Piece:** PVC head piece that unscrews an encloses spot
    GPS devices
2.  **Float collar:** High density foam collar that bolts around main
    body of buoy
3.  **Main PVC body:** Enclosed main PVC body to help keep the buoy
    afloat
4.  **Spar whip:** Blue steel line that attaches to the the main body
    via a bolt sheathed in a PVC pipe. The other end attaches to the top
    end of the array.
5.  **Hand Strap:** Blue steel line that attaches to the float collar
    and the bottom of the main PVC body. Used to pull the buoy onto the
    vessel
6.  **Grappling point:** Line attached to the float collar and surface
    buoy. Used to throw a grappling hook or gaff to retrieve buoy
7.  **Surface buoy:** Surface float that attaches to locking collar

### Getting started with Assembly

1.  Check the hand strap that has been stored. Straighten it out

2.  Unpack the spar whip under the main body.

    1.  You may need to removethe eyebolt to easily do this

3.  Add crab floats:

    -   Put 2 orange crab floats onto the pole so that the flat ends of
        the crab floats butt up against each other

    -   There are bolts that go through the pole at the top and bottom
        of the floats to help keep them in place

    -   We have also been putting a hose clamp between the buoys & the
        bolts, and then wrapping this in electrical tape

4.  Radar reflector and GPS mount:

    -   At the top are the radar reflector and the GPS mount

    -   The radar reflector goes over the pole, and then the GPS mount
        is inserted into the top of the pole

    -   A bolt (currently attached to the GPS mount) holds both in place

    -   The pole, reflectors, and GPS mounts are labeled A, B, C to
        identify sets that fit well together previously

5.  Strobe Light- Prior to deployment, add batteries & zip tie the
    strobe onto the GPS mount

6.  Add reflector tape to the pole below the radar reflector
