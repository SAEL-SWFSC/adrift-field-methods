The ADRIFT project uses drifting acoustic buoys that are composed of a deep hydrophone array (cable with two hydrophones, recorder, depth sensor, and weight at bottom), a weighted High Flyer pole buoy (containing a satellite geo-locator and a radar reflector), and a floating line/surface float to facilitate retrieval. The hydrophone array and High Flyer are connected by ~ 100m Â¼" line with two hard trawl floats (one at the surface, and a subsurface float at depth), a dampener plate with bungees and a drogue (at depth).

## [Surface Buoy](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-field-methods/content/Hardware-Buoy.html)
The purpose of the surface buoy is to help track, find, and support the
drifting recorder. For the Adrift survey, we used a high-flyer style of pole buoy with satellite trackers mounted on the pole and the array is suspended below.

 *Note*: A robust spar buoy developed at PIFSC was implemented as part of the CALCURCEAS survey in 2024.

## [Satellite Tracking](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-field-methods/content/Hardware-Satellite.html)
Satellite trackers are mounted to the surface buoy, and allow for tracking, retrieving, and plotting of movement for analysis. 


## [Subsurface Components](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-field-methods/content/Hardware-Subsurface.html)
The subsurface components include the 'backbone', hydrophone array, recorder, depth sensor, and anchor. The subsurface gear (minus the anchor) are typically stored in a large, red tote.
