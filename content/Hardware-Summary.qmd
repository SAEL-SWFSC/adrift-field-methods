## Summary

The ADRIFT project uses drifting acoustic buoys that are composed of a deep hydrophone array (cable with two hydrophones, recorder, depth sensor, and weight at bottom), a weighted High Flyer pole buoy (containing a satellite geo-locator and a radar reflector), and a floating line/surface float to facilitate retrieval (see Figure 1). The hydrophone array and High Flyer are connected by \~ 100m Â¼" line with two hard trawl floats (one at the surface, and a subsurface float at depth), a dampener plate with bungees and a drogue (at depth). \
\
\*A new PIFSC spar buoy will be implemented as a part of the California Current Ecosystem survey in late 2024. Please see details in the following pages in this book.
