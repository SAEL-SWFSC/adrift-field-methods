## Soundtrap 4300 
The ST4300 is a small autonomous multi-channel recorder; the battery and SD card are sealed in the waterproof housing. The battery can be recharged and the data downloaded using a cable connected to a computer. TWhile limited in battery and storage capacity, the ease of use makes this ideal for shorter deployments (or duty cycled deployments) with inexperienced personnel. The ST4300 is discontinued and was replaced by the ST640.

This link provides information on using the ST640.


## Soundtrap 640
The ST640 is a multi-channel recorder with replaceable batteries and data storage. It has sufficient battery and data storage to allow for extended deployments (> 1 month), but we suggest use by experienced personnel due to the risk of flooding.
